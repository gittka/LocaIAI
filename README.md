# locationApp
App for house's renting (School Work )
This app is a school work, it's a simple app that shows the location houses 
For the purpose to craft a data warehouse, this app is intended to be a simple operational CRUD for  house renting, with the following fields:
Technologies used: Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, MySQL
For reasons of time since it is due in one day, we will do without certain good practices (like DTOs, and others but without exaggerating)
also without a microservice architecture. We will create Excel files in which we will record the data which we will then import to fill our database.
It should be noted that we chose this method because not only will it facilitate the filling of our database because we need millions of records
for future decision analysis purposes and it is also a recommendation of the teacher (Even if the choice remains free)
